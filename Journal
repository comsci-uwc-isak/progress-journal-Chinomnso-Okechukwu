REFLECTION FOR THE HALF TERM
1. What has worked for me in Computer Science is the practice for loops. Like going thoroughly through the basics of something 
which we use in most programs so we can understand fully.
2. I have developed the ability to remain patient and not panic when I do not understand something with the hope that I will 
understand it soon. Also, I've learnt some programming commands.
3. I need to practice programming  more and I think all students should be made to understand the concept fully before going to the next one.
I also need to be familiar with the format of the Computer Science IB exam so I can have a basis of study.
